### CloudBucket
#### by Sahat Yalkabov and Emily Boden
CloudBucket allows you to upload various files and it then tags it automatically based on the filetype. 
For instance music files will be automatically tagged with lyrics, keywords, similar artists, album cover.
Text documents, on the other hand, will have different tags associated with each file - keywords, entities, concepts.
Videos and photos are tagged as well using other techniques.
